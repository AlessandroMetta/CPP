# CPP00
### some notes
- is foundamental to place `std::` before every function that comes from standard header
- `class` is a new object that can define an design object, a C struct-like, but improved, that integrate the function that can access to its variable. Infact another interested feature is the possibility to protect some variables and functions.
- for interact with the I/O, the header is `#include <iostream>`
- the dinamilcal allocate array is replace by `std::vector<type>`, a new type of object that indipendently allocate and reallocate his dimension.
- another new object is `std::pair<type, type>`, a container that can contain two different object.
- another interesting object is `type::iterator`, a pointer to type object taht is use for access to a container.
